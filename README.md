# Minecraftle!

This is a Minecraft themed Wordle!

Players will guess Minecraft words

There are several modes in this game just like there are different game modes in Minecraft:

- Survival: This is the normal version of Wordle

- Creative: Players will be given unlimited tries to guess the word


- Hardcore: After selecting "Survival", the player will be asked if they wanted to play hardcore mode. The player will only be allowed a single try. This is like how in hardcore Minecraft, players will only be allowed one life.
